Deploy keys

A deploy key is an SSH key that is stored on your server and grants access to a single GitHub repository. This key is attached directly to the repository instead of to a personal user account.

Pros

Anyone with access to the repository and server has the ability to deploy the project.
Users don't have to change their local SSH settings.
Deploy keys can read and write by default, but can be made read-only.
Cons

Deploy keys only grant access to a single repository. More complex projects may have many repositories to pull to the same server.
Deploy keys are usually not protected by a passphrase, making the key easily accessible if the server is compromised.
